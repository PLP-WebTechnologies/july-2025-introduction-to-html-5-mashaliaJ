            <h2>History of Kenya</h2>
            <p>A part of Eastern Africa, the territory of what is known as Kenya has seen human habitation since the beginning of the Lower Paleolithic. The Bantu expansion from a West African centre of dispersal reached the area by the 1st millennium AD. With the borders of the modern state at the crossroads of the Bantu, Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic ethno-linguistic areas of Africa, Kenya is a multi-ethnic state.</p>

                <h3>National Integration and Diversity</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kenya has navigated its diversity since gaining independence in 1963, striving to foster national unity despite ethnic differences.</li>
                    <li>Factors like education, the use of a national language (English), participation in cultural festivals, intermarriages, and economic interdependence contribute to national cohesion.</li>
                    <li>However, ethnic-based political parties and past interethnic conflicts highlight the challenges of maintaining unity amidst diversity. </li>
